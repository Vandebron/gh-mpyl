# Developer instructions

You can work on MPyL using two ways:

# Using Devcontainers _(üß™ experimental)_

1. install [DevPod](https://devpod.sh/)
   ```
   brew install --cask devpod
   ```
2. start a new workspace
   ```
   devpod up git@github.com:Vandebron/gh-mpyl.git --id mpyl --ide openvscode
   ```

A new browser window will open with the workspace ready to be worked on üöÄ


### IntelliJ configuration
If you prefer to use a JetBrains IDE, first install [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/) and then run:
```
devpod up mpyl --ide intellij
```
You might have to install the [IntelliJ Python plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/631-python) before being able to work on Python code. If you do, then you'll also need to link to the pre-installed Python interpreter by:
1. open the _Project Structure_ menu
2. in _Platform Settings_ ‚Üí _SDKs_ add a new SDK using _Add Python SDK from disk‚Ä¶_
3. select _Virtualenv Environment_
4. Choose _Existing environment_ and use `/home/vdbnonroot/.local/share/virtualenvs/gh-mpyl/bin/python3.13` as the path to the interpreter

Yes, Python is a PITA üò©. We're hoping to further pre-configure this as soon as IntelliJ supports it.

If you have a PyCharm license this is all probably pre-configured for you. You can use it with:
```
devpod up mpyl --ide pycharm
```


### SSH into the container
If you're more comfortable in a black and white terminal, then you can also just ssh into the container by running:
```
devpod ssh mpyl
```
or just simply:
```
ssh mpyl.devpod
```


# Local installation _(stable)_

## ..install mpyl for development

1. Clone the mpyl repo
 ```shell
 gh repo clone Vandebron/gh-mpyl
 ```

2. Install dependencies
 ```shell
 pipenv install -d
 ```

## ..run tests and checks

To run linting (`pylint`), type checking (`mypy`) and testing (`pytest`) in one go, run:

```shell
pipenv run validate
```

## ..create a pull request build

After working on a branch in MPyL repo, you can open a PR.
After every push, if all validations pass, a test release is pushed to https://test.pypi.org/project/mpyl/.
The naming of the version follows a `<pr_number>.<build_number>` pattern.

A pull request build can be used in `Pipfile` via

```shell
pipenv install --index https://test.pypi.org/simple/ mpyl==<PR_NUMBER>.*
```

Resulting in:

```toml
[[source]]
url = "https://test.pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = false
name = "test"

[packages]
mpyl = { version = "==28.403", index = "test" }
```

## ..code style

We use the [black formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html) in our codebase.
Check the instructions on how to set it up for your
IDE [here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html).

## ..create a new release

1. Create a new release notes file in [releases/notes/](releases/notes/) and name it `<version>.md`
   Noteworthy changes should be added to this file. Think: new cli commands, new features, breaking changes, upgrade
   instructions, etc.
   Ideally create this file already when starting to work on a new version.
   Each PR that is to be included in that release, can add their notes to this file.
2. Check out main and pull the latest changes
3. Choose what release type you want to create. We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The most important distinction is between regular releases and release candidates.
   1. A *release candidate* does not require release notes and will be published to [test pypi](https://test.pypi.org/project/mpyl/).
   2. A *regular release* requires does require and will be published to [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/mpyl/).
4. Run `pipenv run release create`
5. Merge the PR created by this command
6. Run `pipenv run release publish` on main to publish the release

## ..troubleshoot Python setup

1. Check if you're in the correct `venv`
   To check this, run first:
    ```shell
    pipenv shell
    ```
   Then check if the correct virtual environment (named `pympl`) is launched.
2. Check your `bashrc` (or `zshrc`) if you have any overrides of environmental variables like `PIPENV_PIPFILE`. If so,
   remove those, source your bash config and try Step 1. again
3. To see if everything is running as intended, execute
    ```shell
    pipenv run test
    ```
   which should now succeed.

## ..installing a test release of MPyL
Test versions of MPyL are published for every pull request to [test pypi](https://test.pypi.org/project/mpyl/).
To install a test release, run:
```shell
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple mpyl==<version>
```

## ..running the mpyl sourcecode against another repository

For a shorter feedback loop, you can run the mpyl sourcecode against another repository.
To test the mpyl sourcecode against the peculiarities of your own repository, you can run the following command:

```shell
PIPENV_PIPFILE=/<absolute_path_to_mpyl_repo>/Pipfile pipenv run cli-ext build status
```
Assign PIPENV_PIPFILE to the absolute path of your Pipfile and run the command.
‚ö†Ô∏èNote that an `.env` file needs to be present in the root if this repository, containing the following variable:

```shell
PYTHONPATH=/<absolute_path_to_mpyl_repo>/src
```
