#### Demonstrate MPyL plugin mechanism.
MPyL allows steps to be implemented outside and registered via a [plugin mechanism](https://vandebron.github.io/mpyl/mpyl/steps.html)

Creating steps outside the MPyL library gives a much quicker roundtrip, 
because you can build and test steps locally in the repo in which you're using MPyL.

The mechanism is demonstrated in [plugin-run.py](../../plugin-run.py) which imports two
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build steps defined in [plugins/gradle.py](../../plugins/gradle.py).
